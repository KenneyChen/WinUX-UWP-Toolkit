WinUX UWP is the essential toolkit to get developers started with the XAML controls, converters, behaviors, state triggers and extensions commonly used in app development.

## <a id="about">Why WinUX?</a>
I've been developing Windows apps since 2010 and with each project, I noticed a pattern of repeating similar XAML controls and extensions. This involved a lot of copy and pasting.

The aim of WinUX was to fix just that! WinUX provides a core collection of extensions to the Windows app platform to make it easier for developers to make their apps great, without the time and effort of in adding common functionality.
