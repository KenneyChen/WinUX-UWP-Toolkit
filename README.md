# Croft-Core

## About
I have built a lot of Windows apps over the last few years which have required a similar set of XAML extensions and controls that I've copied, pasted and reused amongst them all. This project is going to become the core for all of those features so that not only myself, but you reading this, can save time and effort in adding this common, core functionality into your apps so you have the time to spend enhancing your experiences.

## What's in the box
As this is going to be an on-going project with numerous features being added as and when needed, [you can keep up-to-date with all of the common features on the Wiki](https://github.com/jamesmcroft/Croft-Core/wiki).

## FAQ
### Can I use this in my own project?
Of course you can. Feel free to download the source and have a play around with it, or alternatively, there is a Nuget package available for you to add straight into your projects through Visual Studio.

### I've got some bits I'd like to add, can I?
Again, you sure can. Although I've tailored the current core parts of this project to my own needs, I'm more than happy to see improvements made to things I've added as well as anything new you feel is missing!
